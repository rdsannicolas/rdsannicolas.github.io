Hello! My name is Roland San Nicolas (the last name has 2 words, like 'San Diego') and I live in Washington State.


My career includes being a product specialist; i've specialized in Microsoft Exchange, CommVault Simpana, and EMC backup solutions including Data Domain and Avamar.


When i'm not working, i'm either working out at a CrossFit gym, or playing my guitars.
