Hello! My name is Roland San Nicolas (the last name has 2 words like 'San Francisco') and I live in Washington State.


In the past I have worked for Microsoft, EMC, and CommVault where I was a product specialist performing pre-sales activities. I have also worked for partners including infoWAN Datenkommunikaton GmbH in Munich, Germany and Denali Advanced Integration in Redmond, WA where I specialized in Microsoft Exchange Server and Backup respectively; performing both pre and post sales activities. Currently, I'm exploring programming and I have learned Python and Javascript.

Personal hobbies include keeping up with technology, doing CrossFit workouts, or playing my guitars.
