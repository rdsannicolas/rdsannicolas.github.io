I discovered CrossFit by accident. I had just turned 40, tried getting out of bed one morning and my back ached. I don't know why it ached, but I thought that I was just getting older and perhaps I should do more exercise. I tried running but I hate running. Also my knee started to ache when I ran. I tried doing 10 pushups and 10 situps, sometimes both in one day...sometimes one after the other...at that time 10 was all I could do.

How I discovered CrossFit was simply driving by a CrossFit gym in Port Orchard. There was a stop sign almost a block away from this gym, and one time during rush hour traffic my car was stopped in front of this gym, and I saw people running in and out of the building (one of the runners was wearing a weighted vest), and I saw barbells going up and down...I was immediately interested.

One day as I was driving by this gym, I pulled over and walked in. And the rest, they say, was history :)
