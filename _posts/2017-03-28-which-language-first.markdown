There are many programming languages to choose from; C, C++, C#, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript just to name a few.

But which one to learn first if you have never programmed before?

It depends.

In my personal experience, I wish I would have started with Python. My first journey to learn to program was to create web pages which uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For me, I found CSS difficult to learn because I felt I was just not creative enough to decide how a web page should look, and I was fumbling with the many CSS rules that I found User Interface design frustrating. And learning JavaScript at the same time did not help.

I learned Python during a night course and found the language easier to grasp. Because I did not have to worry about UI design I felt I could focus just on code logic. Also, Python was just easier to write. No semicolons to worry about, did not have to worry about ending function definitions properly, you just had to watch your code indenting. Because of this, I felt I was able to focus on learning the code logic that I was becoming more successful with the language.

Interestingly enough, after learning Python I revisited my past JavaScript assignments and reading them made sense.

But everyone is different, and perhaps it depends on what you need to work on at the time. If you are primarily a Systems Administrator, perhaps Ruby would be the way to go. If you absolutely love websites and are intrigued by how the dynamics of a web page works, then JavaScript it is. However, as a general purpose language that is fairly easy to read and write, I would go with Python.
