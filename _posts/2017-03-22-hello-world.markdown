This is my first Jekyll post. I discovered Jekyll from reading about GitHub Pages where I read the link to "Blogging with Jekyll". It took a while to get used to, but after hacking around I was able to work my way around to finally creating this blog site.

The purpose of this site is to get more experience using GitHub, GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and web site development in general.
