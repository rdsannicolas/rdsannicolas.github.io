Hello World! This is my first Jekyll post. I discovered Jekyll from reading about GitHub Pages where I read the link to "Blogging with Jekyll". I thought it made sense since it was first of all free, and I simply like learning new things. It took a while to get used to, but after hacking around I was able to work my way around to finally creating this blog site.
